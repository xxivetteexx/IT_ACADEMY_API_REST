        'Accept': 'application/json'

### Level :one: 

```Exercice 1```

Develop a joke website with this functions:

- When you entern any joke will appear. We can just see the title and the "following joke" button.

```Exercice 2```

Modify the previous website in order that the joke appears on the website and not by console.
